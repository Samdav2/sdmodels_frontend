# 🚀 IDE Features - Quick Start Guide

## Welcome to HWC3D's Professional IDE!

Your Model View Page now includes 6 revolutionary tools that transform browsing into a professional development experience.

---

## 🔬 1. Topology Health Scan

**What it does**: Analyzes mesh quality and shows you exactly what you're buying.

**How to use**:
1. Click "Topology Health Scan" in the right sidebar
2. Check the Mesh Integrity Score (aim for 95%+)
3. Switch between inspection modes:
   - **Normal**: Standard view
   - **Heatmap**: Green = good quads, Red = bad n-gons
   - **UV Map**: See texture layout
   - **Clay**: Clean geometry view
4. Review topology breakdown (Quads, Tris, N-gons)
5. Export health report for your records

**Why it matters**: Know the quality before you buy. Professional models should have 95%+ clean topology.

## 🥽 2. AR / VR Viewer

**What it does**: View the model in Augmented Reality or Virtual Reality.

**How to use**:

### AR Mode (Mobile)
1. Click "Launch AR Mode"
2. Point your phone camera at a flat surface
3. Tap to place the model
4. Walk around it in real space
5. Pinch to scale, drag to rotate

### VR Mode (Desktop)
1. Connect your VR headset
2. Click "Launch WebXR"
3. Put on your headset
4. Use controllers to interact
5. Press menu button to exit

**Why it matters**: See the model at real-world scale before purchasing. Perfect for checking if it fits your project.

## ⚡ 3. Physics & Ragdoll Tester

**What it does**: Tests how rigged models react to gravity, wind, and physics.

**How to use**:
1. Click "Enable Physics"
2. Choose an environment preset:
   - Earth (normal gravity)
   - Moon (low gravity)
   - Zero-G (floating)
   - Storm (high wind)
3. Or adjust manually:
   - Gravity slider
   - Wind force slider
   - Bounciness slider
   - Friction slider
4. Click and drag the model to toss it
5. Watch how cloth, hair, and rigging react

**Why it matters**: Verify that rigged characters have proper weight painting and will work correctly in your game engine.

## 🎬 4. Scene Prototyper

**What it does**: Add reference objects to test the model's real-world scale.

**How to use**:
1. Click "Scene Prototyper"
2. Add reference objects:
   - Human (1.75m) - for character scale
   - Car (4.5m) - for vehicle scale
   - Crate (1m) - for prop scale
   - Door (2m) - for architecture
   - Tree (8m) - for environment
   - Building (15m) - for large structures
3. Compare your model to these references
4. Remove objects or clear all
5. Save scene configuration

**Why it matters**: Ensure your model is correctly scaled. Game engines expect specific sizes (e.g., 1.75m for humans).

## 🤖 5. AI Texture Generator

**What it does**: Generate custom AI textures and preview them on the model.

**How to use**:
1. Click "AI Texture Generator"
2. Type a description:
   - "Rusty metal with scratches"
   - "Worn leather with stitching"
   - "Polished gold armor"
3. Or click a quick prompt
4. Select a style:
   - Realistic
   - Stylized
   - PBR
   - Cartoon
   - Sci-Fi
   - Fantasy
5. Click "Generate Texture"
6. Preview appears on model (watermarked)
7. Purchase to get full 4K resolution

**Why it matters**: Customize models to match your project's art style. Preview before buying.

---

## 🎮 6. Engine Compatibility

**What it does**: Shows exactly how to import the model into your game engine.

**How to use**:
1. Click "Engine Compatibility"
2. Select your engine:
   - Unity
   - Unreal Engine
   - Godot
   - Blender
   - Three.js
   - Babylon.js
3. View compatibility percentage
4. See supported formats
5. Copy import code to clipboard
6. Read engine-specific tips

**Why it matters**: Save hours of setup time. Get working code instantly.
